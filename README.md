# GranulatorC
Granulator C is a granular instrument built based on the partikkel  opcode in Csound. The instrument enables the user to choose an audio file and use the instrument to granulize it. The purpose of the project is to give users intuitive yet effective control over samples by using a series of time-domain varieties of granular synthesis techniques. The instrument is available in terms of stand alone application as well as AU/VST. 

The idea of Abletonâ€™s granulator inspires me a lot in my daily production and sound design work. However, it has too many functions and a lot of them are not normally used or unnecessary. Also, the idea of granular synthesis is complicated to beginner users. With GranulatorC, users could hear instant difference on their favorite samples with the tweak of just a few nobs. Not only it is easy-to-use, but it is also worthy to just play with it and experience the power of granular synthesis.

The sample control module controls the amplitude and the playback speed of the original sample. The grain control module controls the grain size, grain rate, and playback position randomness. The pitch control module transposes the sample, and the cent.rand nob gives random transposition by cents.
