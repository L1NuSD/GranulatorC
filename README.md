# GranulatorC
Granulator C is a granular instrument built based on the partikkel  opcode in Csound. The instrument enables the user to choose an audio file and use the instrument to granulize it. The purpose of the project is to give users intuitive yet effective control over samples by using a series of time-domain varieties of granular synthesis techniques. The instrument is available in terms of stand alone application as well as AU/VST. 

### Design 
The sample control module controls the amplitude and the playback speed of the original sample. The grain control module controls the grain size, grain rate, and playback position randomness. The pitch control module transposes the sample, and the cent.rand nob gives random transposition by cents.
